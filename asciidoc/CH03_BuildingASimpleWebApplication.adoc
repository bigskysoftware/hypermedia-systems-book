= A Web 1.0 Application
:chapter: 03
:url: /a-web-1-0-application/

To start our journey into Hypermedia-Driven Applications, we are going to create a simple contact management web
application called Contact.app.  We will start with a basic, "`Web 1.0-style`" Multi-Page Application (MPA), in the grand
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tradition.  It will not be the best contact management application in the world, but
it will be simple and it will do its job.

This application will also be easy to incrementally improve in the coming chapters by utilizing the hypermedia-oriented
library htmx.

By the time we are finished building and enhancing the application, over the next few chapters, it will have some very
slick features that most developers today would assume requires the use of a SPA JavaScript framework.

== Picking A "`Web Stack`"

In order to demonstrate how web 1.0 applications work, we need to pick a server-side language and a library for
handling HTTP requests.  Colloquially, this is called our "`Server-Side`" or "`Web`" stack, and there are literally hundreds
of options to choose from, many with passionate followings.  You probably have a web framework that you prefer and, while
we wish we could write this book for every possible stack out there, in the interest of simplicity (and sanity) we can only pick one.

For this book we are going to use the following stack:

* https://www.python.org/[Python] as our programming language.
* https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/[Flask] as our web framework, allowing us to connect HTTP requests to Python logic.
* https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/[Jinja2] for our server-side templating language, allowing us to render HTML responses using a familiar
  and intuitive syntax.

Why this particular stack?

Python is the most popular programming language in the world, as of this writing, according to the
https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/[TIOBE index], a respected measure of programming language popularity.
More importantly, Python is easy to read even if you aren't familiar with it.

We chose the Flask web framework because it is simple and does not impose a lot of structure on top of the
basics of HTTP request handling.

This bare-bones approach is a good match for our needs: in other cases you might consider a more full-featured Python
framework, such as https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django], which supplies much more functionality out of the box than
Flask does.

By using Flask for our book, we will be able to keep our code focused on _hypermedia exchanges_.

We picked Jinja2 templates because they are the default templating language for Flask.  They are simple enough and
similar enough to most other server-side templating languages that most people who are familiar with any server-side
(or client-side) templating library should be able to understand them quickly and easily.

Even if this combination of technologies isn't your preferred stack, please, keep reading: you will learn quite a bit from
the patterns we introduce in the coming chapters and it shouldn't be hard to map them into your preferred language and
frameworks.

With this stack we will be rendering HTML _on the server-side_ to return to clients, rather than producing JSON.  This
is the traditional approach to building web applications.  However, with the rise of SPAs, this approach is not as
widely used a technique as it once was.  Today, as people are rediscovering this style of web applications, the term
"`Server-Side Rendering`" or SSR is emerging as the way that people talk about it.  This contrasts with
"`Client-Side Rendering`", that is, rendering templates in the browser with data retrieved in JSON form from the server,
as is common in SPA libraries.

In Contact.app we will intentionally keep things as simple as possible to maximize the teaching value of our code: it
won't be perfectly factored code, but it will be easy to follow for readers, even if they have little Python experience,
and it should be easy to translate both the application and the techniques demonstrated into your preferred programming
environment.

== Python

Since this book is for learning how to use hypermedia effectively, we'll just briefly introduce
the various technologies we use _around_ that hypermedia.  This has some obvious drawbacks: if you aren't comfortable
with Python, for example, some example Python code in the book may be a bit confusing or mysterious at first.

If you feel like you need a quick introduction to the language before diving into the code, we recommend the following
books and websites:

* https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition[Python Crash Course] from No Starch Press
* https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/[Learn Python The Hard Way] by Zed Shaw
* https://www.py4e.com/[Python For Everybody] by Dr. Charles R. Severance

We think most web developers, even developers who are unfamiliar with Python, should be able to follow
along with our examples. Most of the authors of this book hadn't written much Python before writing it, and we got the
hang of it pretty quickly.


== Introducing Flask: Our First Route

(((Flask, about)))
Flask is a simple but flexible web framework for Python. We'll ease into it by touching on its core elements.

(((Flask, routes)))
(((Flask, handlers)))
(((Flask, decorators)))
A Flask application consists of a series of _routes_ tied to functions that execute when an HTTP request to a given path is
made.  It uses a Python feature called "`decorators`" to declare the route that will be handled, which is then followed by
a function to handle requests to that route.  We'll use the term "`handler`" to refer to the functions associated
with a route.

Let's create our first route definition, a simple "`Hello World`" route.  In the following Python code you will see the
`@app` symbol.  This is the flask decorator that allows us to set up our routes.  Don't worry too much about
how decorators work in Python, just know that this feature allows us to map a given _path_ to a particular function
(i.e., handler).  The Flask application, when started, will take HTTP requests and look up the matching handler and
invoke it.

.A simple "`Hello World`" route
[source,python]
----
@app.route("/") <1>
def index(): <2>
    return "Hello World!" <3>
----
<1> Establishes we are mapping the `/` path as a route.
<2> The next method is the handler for that route.
<3> Returns the string "`Hello World!`" to the client.

The `route()` method on the Flask decorator takes an argument: the path you wish the route to handle.  Here we
pass in the root or `/` path, as a string, to handle requests to the root path.

This route declaration is then followed by a simple function definition, `index()`.  In Python, decorators invoked in
this manner apply to the function immediately following them.  Therefore, this function becomes the "`handler`" for that
route, and will be executed when an HTTP request to the given path is made.

Note that the name of the function doesn't matter, we can call it whatever we'd like so long as it is unique.  In this
case we chose `index()` because that fits with the route we are handling: the root "`index`" of the web
application.

So we have the `index()` function immediately following our route definition for the root, and this will become the
handler for the root URL in our web application.

The handler in this case is dead simple, it just returns a string, "`Hello World!`", to the client.  This isn't
hypermedia yet, but a browser will render it just fine:

.Hello World!
image::figure_2-1_hello_world.png[Browser window, large text: Hello World!]

Great, there's our first step into Flask, showing the core technique we are going to use to respond to HTTP requests:
routes mapped to handlers.

For Contact.app, rather than rendering "`Hello World!`" at the root path, we are going to do something a little fancy:
we are going to redirect to another path, the `/contacts` path.  Redirects are a feature of HTTP that allow you to
redirect a client to another location with an HTTP response.

(((Flask, redirect)))
We are going to display a list of contacts as our root page, and, arguably, redirecting to the `/contacts` path to
display this information is a bit more consistent with the notion of resources with REST.  This is a judgement call on our
part, and not something we feel is too important, but it makes sense in terms of routes we will set up later in the
application.

To change our "`Hello World`" route to a redirect, we only need to change one line of code:

.Changing "`Hello World`" to a redirect
[source,python]
----
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return redirect("/contacts") <1>
----
<1> Update to a call to `redirect()`


Now the `index()` function returns the result of the Flask-supplied `redirect()` function with the path
we've supplied. In this case the path is `/contacts`, passed in as a string argument.
Now, if you navigate to the root path, `/`, our Flask application will forward you on to the `/contacts` path.

== Contact.app Functionality

(((Contact.app, specs)))
Now that we have some understanding of how to define routes, let's get down to specifying and then implementing
our web application.

What will Contact.app do?

Initially, it will allow users to:

* View a list of contacts, including first name, last name, phone and email address
* Search the contacts
* Add a new contact
* View the details of a contact
* Edit the details of a contact
* Delete a contact

(((CRUD)))
So, as you can see, Contact.app is a CRUD application, the sort of application that is perfect for an old-school
web 1.0 approach.

Note that the source code of Contact.app is available on https://github.com/bigskysoftware/contact-app[GitHub].

=== Showing A Searchable List Of Contacts

Let's add our first real bit of functionality: the ability to show all the contacts in our app in a list (really,
in a table).

This functionality is going to be found at the `/contacts` path, which is the path our previous route is redirecting to.

We will use Flask to route the `/contacts` path to a handler function, `contacts()`. This function will do one of
two things:

* If there is a search term found in the request, it will filter down to only contacts matching that term
* If not, it will simply list all contacts

This is a common approach in web 1.0 style applications: the same URL that displays all instances of some resource
also serves as the search results page for those resources.  Taking this approach makes it easy to reuse the list
display that is common to both types of request.

Here is what the code looks like for this handler:

.A handler for server-side search
[source,python]
----
@app.route("/contacts")
def contacts():
    search = request.args.get("q") <1>
    if search is not None:
        contacts_set = Contact.search(search) <2>
    else:
        contacts_set = Contact.all() <3>
    return render_template("index.html", contacts=contacts_set) <4>
----
<1> Look for the query parameter named `q`, which stands for "`query.`"
<2> If the parameter exists, call the `Contact.search()` function with it.
<3> If not, call the `Contact.all()` function.
<4> Pass the result to the `index.html` template to render to the client.

(((query strings)))
We see the same sort of routing code we saw in our first example, but we have a more elaborate handler function.
First, we check to see if a search query parameter named `q` is part of the request.

Query Strings:: A [.dfn]"`query string`" is  part of the URL specification.  Here is an example URL with a query string in it:
`https://example.com/contacts?q=joe`.  The query string is everything after the `?`, and has a
name-value pair format.  In this URL, the query parameter `q` is set to the string value `joe`.  In plain HTML, a
query string can be included in a request either by being hardcoded in an anchor tag or, more dynamically, by
using a form tag with a `GET` request.

To return to our Flask route, if a query parameter named `q` is found, we call out to the `search()` method on a
`Contact` model object to do the actual contact search and return all the matching contacts.

If the query parameter is _not_ found, we simply get all contacts by invoking the `all()` method on the `Contact` object.

Finally, we render a template, `index.html` that displays the given contacts, passing in the results of whichever
of these two functions we end up calling.

.A Note On The Contact Class
****
The `Contact` Python class we're using is the "`domain
model`" or just "`model`" class for our application, providing the "`business logic`" around the management of Contacts.

(((Contact.app, model)))
It could be working with a database (it isn't) or a simple flat file (it is), but we're going to skip over the internal details of the model. Think of it as a "`normal`" domain model class, with methods on it that act in a "`normal`" manner.

We will treat `Contact` as a _resource_, and focus on how to effectively provide hypermedia representations
of that resource to clients.
****

==== The list & search templates

Now that we have our handler logic written, we'll create a template to render
HTML in our response to the client.  At a high level, our HTML response needs to have the following elements:

* A list of any matching or all contacts.
* A search box where a user may type and submit search terms.
* A bit of surrounding "`chrome`": a header and footer for the website that will be the same regardless of the page you
  are on.

(((templates)))
(((Jinja2, about)))
We are using the Jinja2 templating language, which has the following features:

- We can use double-curly braces, `{{ }}`,  to embed expression values in the template.
- we can use curly-percents, ``{% %}``, for directives, like iteration or including other content.

Beyond this basic syntax, Jinja2 is very similar to other templating languages used to generate content, and should
be easy to follow for most web developers.

Let's look at the first few lines of code in the `index.html` template:

.Start of index.html
[source, html]
----
{% extends 'layout.html' %} <1>

{% block content %} <2>

    <form action="/contacts" method="get" class="tool-bar">  <3>
            <label for="search">Search Term</label>
            <input id="search" type="search" name="q" value="{{ request.args.get('q') or '' }}"/> <4>
            <input type="submit" value="Search"/>
     </form>
----
<1> Set the layout template for this template.
<2> Delimit the content to be inserted into the layout.
<3> Create a search form that will issue an HTTP `GET` to `/contacts`.
<4> Create an input for a user to type search queries.

The first line of code references a base template, `layout.html`, with the `extends` directive.  This layout
template provides the layout for the page (again, sometimes called "`the chrome`"): it wraps the template content in an
`<html>` tag, imports any necessary CSS and JavaScript in a `<head>` element, places a `<body>` tag around the main
content and so forth.  All the common content wrapped around the "`normal`" content for the entire application
is located in this file.

The next line of code declares the `content` section of this template.  This content block is used by the `layout.html`
template to inject the content of `index.html` within its HTML.

Next we have our first bit of actual HTML, rather than just Jinja directives.  We have a simple HTML form that allows
you to search contacts by issuing a `GET` request to the `/contacts` path.  The form itself contains a label and
an input with the name "`q.`" This input's value will be submitted with the `GET` request to the `/contacts` path,
as a query string (since this is a `GET` request.)

Note that the value of this input is set to the Jinja expression `{{ request.args.get('q') or '' }}`.  This expression
is evaluated by Jinja and will insert the request value of "`q`" as the input's value, if it exists.  This will "`preserve`"
the search value when a user does a search, so that when the results of a search are rendered the text input contains
the term that was searched for.  This makes for a better user experience since the user can see exactly what the
current results match, rather than having a blank text box at the top of the screen.

Finally, we have a submit-type input.  This will render as a button and, when it is clicked, it will trigger the
form to issue an HTTP request.

(((Contact.app, table)))
This search interface forms the top of our contact page.  Following it is a table of contacts, either all contacts or the
contacts that match the search, if a search was done.

Here is what the template code for the contact table looks like:

.The contacts table
[source, html]
----
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>First</th> <th>Last</th> <th>Phone</th> <th>Email</th> <th></th><1>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {% for contact in contacts %} <2>
            <tr>
                <td>{{ contact.first }}</td>
                <td>{{ contact.last }}</td>
                <td>{{ contact.phone }}</td>
                <td>{{ contact.email }}</td> <3>
                <td><a href="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit">Edit</a>
                    <a href="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}">View</a></td> <4>
            </tr>
        {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
    </table>
----
<1> Output some headers for our table.
<2> Iterate over the contacts that were passed in to the template.
<3> Output the values of the current contact, first name, last name, etc.
<4> An "operations" column, with links to edit or view the contact details.

This is the core of the page: we construct a table with appropriate headers matching the data we are going
to show for each contact.  We iterate over the contacts that were passed into the template by the handler method using
the `for` loop directive in Jinja2.  We then construct a series of rows, one for each contact, where we render the
first and last name, phone and email of the contact as table cells in the row.

Additionally, we have a table cell that includes two links:

* A link to the "Edit" page for the contact, located at `/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit` (e.g., For the contact with
  id 42, the edit link will point to `/contacts/42/edit`)

* A link to the "View" page for the contact `/contacts/{{ contact.id }}` (using our previous contact example, the view
  page would be at `/contacts/42`)


Finally, we have a bit of end-matter: a link to add a new contact and a Jinja2 directive to end the `content` block:

.The "`add contact`" link
[source, html]
----
    <p>
        <a href="/contacts/new">Add Contact</a> <1>
    </p>

{% endblock %} <2>
----
<1>  Link to the page that allows you to create a new contact.
<2>  The closing element of the `content` block.

And that's our complete template.  Using this simple server-side template, in combination with our handler method, we
can respond with an HTML _representation_ of all the contacts requested.  So far, so hypermedia.

Here is what the template looks like, rendered with a bit of contact information:

.Contact.app
image::figure_2-2_table_etc.png[Table showing info of 3 contacts with a title and a search bar above and an Add Contact link below]


Now, our application won't win any design awards at this point, but notice that our template, when rendered,
provides all the functionality necessary to see all the contacts and search them, and also provides links to edit them,
view details of them or even create a new one.

And it does all this without the client (that is, the browser) knowing a thing about what contacts are or how to
work with them.  Everything is encoded _in_ the hypermedia.  A web browser accessing this application just knows how to
issue HTTP requests and then render HTML, nothing more about the specifics of our applications end points or underlying
domain model.

As simple as our application is at this point, it is thoroughly RESTful.

=== Adding A New Contact

The next bit of functionality that we will add to our application is the ability to add new contacts.  To do this, we
are going to need to handle that `/contacts/new` URL referenced in the "`Add Contact`" link above.  Note that when a user
clicks on that link, the browser will issue a `GET` request to the `/contacts/new` URL.

All the other routes we have so far use `GET` as well, but we are actually going to use two
different HTTP methods for this bit of functionality: an HTTP `GET` to render a form for adding a new contact,
and then an HTTP `POST` _to the same path_ to actually create the contact, so we are going to be explicit about the
HTTP method we want to handle when we declare this route.

Here is the code:

.The "`new contact`" GET route
[source,python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/new", methods=['GET']) <1>
def contacts_new_get():
    return render_template("new.html", contact=Contact()) <2>
----
<1> Declare a route, explicitly handling `GET` requests to this path.
<2> Render the `new.html` template, passing in a new contact object.

Simple enough. We just render a `new.html` template with a new Contact.  (`Contact()` is how you construct a new instance
of the `Contact` class in Python, if you aren't familiar with it.)

While the handler code for this route is very simple, the `new.html` template is more complicated.

****
For the remaining templates we are going to omit the layout directive and the content block declaration, but you
can assume they are the same unless we say otherwise.  This will let us focus on the "meat" of the template.
****

If you are familiar with HTML you are probably expecting a form element here, and you will not be disappointed.  We are
going to use the standard form hypermedia control for collecting contact information and submitting it to the server.

Here is what our HTML looks like:

.The "`new contact`" form
[source, html]
----
<form action="/contacts/new" method="post"> <1>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Contact Values</legend>
        <p>
            <label for="email">Email</label> <2>
            <input name="email" id="email" type="email" placeholder="Email" value="{{ contact.email or '' }}"> <3>
            <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['email'] }}</span> <4>
        </p>
----
<1> A form that submits to the `/contacts/new` path, using an HTTP `POST`.
<2> A label for the first form input.
<3> The first form input, of type email.
<4> Any error messages associated with this field.

In the first line of code we create a form that will submit back _to the same path_ that we are handling: `/contacts/new`.
Rather than issuing an HTTP `GET` to this path, however, we will issue an HTTP `POST` to it.  Using a `POST` in this manner
will signal to the server that we want to create a new Contact, rather than get a form for creating one.

We then have a label (always a good practice!) and an input that captures the email of
the contact being created.  The name of the input is `email` and, when this form is submitted, the value of this input
will be submitted in the `POST` request, associated with the `email` key.

Next we have inputs for the other fields for contacts:

.Inputs and labels for the "`new contact`" form
[source, html]
----
        <p>
            <label for="first_name">First Name</label>
            <input name="first_name" id="first_name" type="text" placeholder="First Name" value="{{ contact.first or '' }}">
            <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['first'] }}</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <label for="last_name">Last Name</label>
            <input name="last_name" id="last_name" type="text" placeholder="Last Name" value="{{ contact.last or '' }}">
            <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['last'] }}</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <label for="phone">Phone</label>
            <input name="phone" id="phone" type="text" placeholder="Phone" value="{{ contact.phone or '' }}">
            <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['phone'] }}</span>
        </p>
----

Finally, we have a button that will submit the form, the end of the form tag, and a link back to the main contacts table:

.The submit button for the "`new contact`" form
[source, html]
----
        <button>Save</button>
    </fieldset>
</form>

<p>
    <a href="/contacts">Back</a>
</p>
----

It is easy to miss in this straight-forward example: we are seeing the flexibility of hypermedia in action.

If we add a new field, remove a field, or change the logic around how fields are validated or work with one another,
this new state of affairs would be reflected in the new hypermedia representation given to users.  A user would see the
updated new form and be able to work with these new features, with no software update required.

==== Handling the post to /contacts/new

The next step in our application is to handle the `POST` that this form makes to `/contacts/new`.

To do so, we need to add another route to our application that handles the `/contacts/new` path. The new route will handle an HTTP `POST` method instead of an HTTP `GET`.  We will use the submitted form values to attempt to
create a new Contact.

If we are successful in creating a Contact, we will redirect the user to the list of contacts and show a success message.
If we aren't successful, then we will render the new contact form again with whatever values the user entered and
render error messages about what issues need to be fixed so that the user can correct them.

Here is our new request handler:

.The "`new contact`" controller code
[source, python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/new", methods=['POST'])
def contacts_new():
    c = Contact(None, request.form['first_name'], request.form['last_name'], request.form['phone'],
                request.form['email']) <1>
    if c.save(): <2>
        flash("Created New Contact!")
        return redirect("/contacts") <3>
    else:
        return render_template("new.html", contact=c) <4>
----
<1> We construct a new contact object with the values from the form.
<2> We try to save it.
<3> On success, "`flash`" a success message & redirect to the `/contacts` page.
<4> On failure, re-render the form, showing any errors to the user.


The logic in this handler is a bit more complex than other methods we have seen.  The first thing
we do is create a new Contact, again using the `Contact()` syntax in Python to construct the object.  We pass in the values
that the user submitted in the form by using the `request.form` object, a feature provided by Flask.

This `request.form` allows us to access submitted form values in an easy and convenient way, by simply passing in the same
name associated with the various inputs.

We also pass in `None` as the first value to the `Contact` constructor.  This is the "`id`" parameter, and by passing in
`None` we are signaling that it is a new contact, and needs to have an ID generated for it.    (Again, we are not
going into the details of how this model object is implemented, our only concern is using it to generate
hypermedia responses.)

Next, we call the `save()` method on the Contact object.  This method returns `true` if the save is successful, and `false` if
the save is unsuccessful (for example, a bad email was submitted by the user).

If we are able to save the contact (that is, there were no validation errors), we create a _flash_ message indicating
success, and redirect the browser back to the list page.  A "`flash`" is a common feature in web frameworks that allows
you to store a message that will be available on the _next_ request, typically in a cookie or in a session store.

Finally, if we are unable to save the contact, we re-render the `new.html` template with the contact.  This will show the
same template as above, but the inputs will be filled in with the submitted values, and any errors associated with the
fields will be rendered to feedback to the user as to what validation failed.


.The Post/Redirect/Get Pattern
****
((("Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)")))
This handler implements a common strategy in web 1.0-style development called the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get[Post/Redirect/Get] or PRG pattern.  By issuing an HTTP redirect once
a contact has been created and forwarding the browser on to another location, we ensure that the `POST` does not
end up in the browsers request cache.

This means that if the user accidentally (or intentionally) refreshes the page, the browser will not submit another `POST`,
potentially creating another contact.  Instead, it will issue the `GET` that we redirect to, which should be side-effect
free.

We will use the PRG pattern in a few different places in this book.
****

OK, so we have our server-side logic set up to save contacts.  And, believe it or not, this is about as complicated as
our handler logic will get, even when we look at adding more sophisticated htmx-driven behaviors.

=== Viewing The Details Of A Contact

The next piece of functionality we will implement is the detail page for a Contact.  The user will navigate to this
page by clicking the "`View`" link in one of the rows in the list of contacts.  This will take them to the path
`/contact/<contact id>` (e.g., `/contacts/42`).

This is a common pattern in web development: contacts are treated as resources and the URLs around these
resources are organized in a coherent manner.

* If you wish to view all contacts, you issue a `GET` to `/contacts`.
* If you want a hypermedia representation allowing you to create a new contact, you issue a `GET` to `/contacts/new`.
* If you wish to view a specific contact (with, say, an id of `42), you issue a `GET` to `/contacts/42`.

.The Eternal Bike Shed of URL Design
****
It is easy to quibble about the particulars of the path scheme you use for your application:

"`Should we `POST` to `/contacts/new` or to `/contacts`?`"

We have seen many arguments online and in person advocating for one approach versus another.  We feel it is more
important to understand the overarching idea of _resources_ and _hypermedia representations_, rather than
getting worked up about the smaller details of your URL design.

We recommend you just pick a reasonable, resource-oriented URL layout you like and then stay consistent.  Remember,
in a hypermedia system, you can always change your endpoints later, because you are using hypermedia as the engine
of application state!
****

Our handler logic for the detail route is going to be _very_ simple: we just look the Contact up by id, which is embedded in
the path of the URL for the route.  To extract this ID we are going to need to introduce a final bit of Flask
functionality: the ability to call out pieces of a path and have them automatically extracted and passed in to a
handler function.

Here is what the code looks like, just a few lines of simple Python:

[source,python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/<contact_id>") <1>
def contacts_view(contact_id=0): <2>
    contact = Contact.find(contact_id) <3>
    return render_template("show.html", contact=contact) <4>
----
<1> Map the path, with a path variable named `contact_id`.
<2> The handler takes the value of this path parameter.
<3> Look up the corresponding contact.
<4> Render the `show.html` template.

You can see the syntax for extracting values from the path in the first line of code: you enclose the part of the
path you wish to extract in `<>` and give it a name.  This component of the path will be extracted and then passed
into the handler function, via the parameter with the same name.

So, if you were to navigate to the path `/contacts/42`, the value `42` would be passed into the `contacts_view()`
function for the value of `contact_id`.

Once we have the id of the contact we want to look up, we load it up using the `find` method on the `Contact` object.  We
then pass this contact into the `show.html` template and render a response.

=== The Contact Detail Template

Our `show.html` template is relatively simple, just showing the same information as the table but in a slightly different
format (perhaps for printing).  If we add functionality like "`notes`" to the application later on, this will give
us a good place to do so.

Again, we will omit the "`chrome`" of the template and focus on the meat:

.The "`contact details`" template
[source, html]
----
<h1>{{contact.first}} {{contact.last}}</h1>

<div>
  <div>Phone: {{contact.phone}}</div>
  <div>Email: {{contact.email}}</div>
</div>

<p>
  <a href="/contacts/{{contact.id}}/edit">Edit</a>
  <a href="/contacts">Back</a>
</p>
----

We simply render a First Name and Last Name header, with the additional contact information below it,
and a couple of links: a link to edit the contact and a link to navigate back to the full list of contacts.

=== Editing And Deleting A Contact

Next up we will tackle the functionality on the other end of that "`Edit`" link.  Editing a contact is going to look very
similar to creating a new contact.  As with adding a new contact, we are going to need two routes that handle the same
path, but using different HTTP methods: a `GET` to `/contacts/<contact_id>/edit` will return a form allowing you to edit
the contact and a `POST` to that path will update it.

We are also going to piggyback the ability to delete a contact along with this editing functionality.  To do this we
will need to handle a `POST` to `/contacts/<contact_id>/delete`.

Let's look at the code to handle the `GET`, which, again, will return an HTML representation of an editing interface
for the given resource:

.The "`edit contact`" controller code
[source, python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/<contact_id>/edit", methods=["GET"])
def contacts_edit_get(contact_id=0):
    contact = Contact.find(contact_id)
    return render_template("edit.html", contact=contact)
----

As you can see this looks a lot like our "`Show Contact`" functionality.  In fact, it is nearly identical except
for the template: here we render `edit.html` rather than `show.html`.

While our handler code looked similar to the "`Show Contact`" functionality, the `edit.html` template is going to look
very similar to the template for the "`New Contact`" functionality: we will have a form that submits updated contact
values to the same "`edit`" URL and that presents all the fields of a contact as inputs for editing, along with any error
messages.

Here is the first bit of the form:

.The "`edit contact`" form start
[source, html]
----
    <form action="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit" method="post"> <1>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Contact Values</legend>
              <p>
                  <label for="email">Email</label>
                  <input name="email" id="email" type="text" placeholder="Email" value="{{ contact.email }}"> <2>
                  <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['email'] }}</span>
              </p>
----
<1> Issue a `POST` to the `/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/edit` path.
<2> As with the `new.html` page, the input is tied to the contact's email.

This HTML is nearly identical to our `new.html` form, except that this form is going to submit a `POST` to a different
path, based on the id of the contact that we want to update.  (It's worth mentioning here that, rather than `POST`, we
would prefer to use a `PUT` or `PATCH`, but those are not available in plain HTML.)

Following this we have the remainder of our form, again very similar to the `new.html` template, and our button
to submit the form.

.The "`edit contact`" form body
[source, html]
----
              <p>
                  <label for="first_name">First Name</label>
                  <input name="first_name" id="first_name" type="text" placeholder="First Name"
                         value="{{ contact.first }}">
                  <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['first'] }}</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                  <label for="last_name">Last Name</label>
                  <input name="last_name" id="last_name" type="text" placeholder="Last Name"
                         value="{{ contact.last }}">
                  <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['last'] }}</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                  <label for="phone">Phone</label>
                  <input name="phone" id="phone" type="text" placeholder="Phone" value="{{ contact.phone }}">
                  <span class="error">{{ contact.errors['phone'] }}</span>
              </p>
            <button>Save</button>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
----

In the final part of our template we have a small difference between the `new.html` and `edit.html`.  Below the main
editing form, we include a second form that allows you to delete a contact.  It does this by issuing a `POST`
to the `/contacts/<contact id>/delete` path.  Just as we would prefer to use a `PUT` to update a contact, we would
much rather use an HTTP `DELETE` request to delete one.  Unfortunately that also isn't possible in plain HTML.

To finish up the page, there is a simple hyperlink back to the list of contacts.

.The "`edit contact`" form footer
[source, html]
----
    <form action="/contacts/{{ contact.id }}/delete" method="post">
        <button>Delete Contact</button>
    </form>

    <p>
        <a href="/contacts/">Back</a>
    </p>
----

Given all the similarities between the `new.html` and `edit.html` templates, you may be wondering why we are not
_refactoring_ these two templates to share logic between them.  That's a good observation and, in a production system,
we would probably do just that.

For our purposes, however, since our application is small and simple, we will leave the templates separate.


.Factoring Your Applications
****
(((components)))
One thing that often trips people up who are coming to hypermedia applications from a JavaScript background is the
notion of "components".  In JavaScript-oriented applications it is common to break your app up into small
client-side components that are then composed together.  These components are often developed and tested in isolation and
provide a nice abstraction for developers to create testable code.

(((factoring)))
With Hypermedia-Driven Applications, in contrast, you factor your application on the server side.  As we said, the above form could be
refactored into a shared template between the edit and create templates, allowing you to achieve a reusable and DRY (Don't
Repeat Yourself) implementation.

Note that factoring on the server-side tends to be coarser-grained than on the client-side: you tend to split out common
_sections_ rather than create lots of individual components.  This has benefits (it tends to be simple) as well as
drawbacks (it is not nearly as isolated as client-side components).

Overall, a properly factored server-side hypermedia application can be extremely DRY.
****

==== Handling the post to /contacts/<contact_id>/edit

Next we need to handle the HTTP `POST` request that the form in our `edit.html` template submits.  We will declare
another route that handles the same path as the `GET` above.

Here is the new handler code:

(((POST)))
[source, python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/<contact_id>/edit", methods=["POST"]) <1>
def contacts_edit_post(contact_id=0):
    c = Contact.find(contact_id) <2>
    c.update(request.form['first_name'], request.form['last_name'], request.form['phone'], request.form['email']) <3>
    if c.save(): <4>
        flash("Updated Contact!")
        return redirect("/contacts/" + str(contact_id)) <5>
    else:
        return render_template("edit.html", contact=c) <6>
----
<1> Handle a `POST` to `/contacts/<contact_id>/edit`.
<2> Look the contact up by id.
<3> Update the contact with the new information from the form.
<4> Attempt to save it.
<5> On success, flash a success message & redirect to the detail page.
<6> On failure, re-render the edit template, showing any errors.

The logic in this handler is very similar to the logic in the handler for adding a new contact.  The only real difference
is that, rather than creating a new Contact, we look the contact up by id and then call the `update()` method on it with
the values that were entered in the form.

Once again, this consistency between our CRUD operations is one of the nice and simplifying aspects of traditional CRUD web
applications.

=== Deleting A Contact

((("Post/Redirect/Get (PRG)")))
We piggybacked contact delete functionality into the same template used to edit a contact.  This second form will issue
an HTTP `POST` to `/contacts/<contact_id>/delete`, and we will need to create a handler for that path as well.

Here is what the controller looks like:

.The "`delete contact`" controller code
[source, python]
----
@app.route("/contacts/<contact_id>/delete", methods=["POST"]) <1>
def contacts_delete(contact_id=0):
    contact = Contact.find(contact_id)
    contact.delete() <2>
    flash("Deleted Contact!")
    return redirect("/contacts") <3>
----
<1> Handle a `POST` the `/contacts/<contact_id>/delete` path.
<2> Look up and then invoke the `delete()` method on the contact.
<3> Flash a success message and redirect to the main list of contacts.

The handler code is very simple since we don't need to do any validation or conditional logic: we simply look up the
contact the same way we have been doing in our other handlers and invoke the `delete()` method on it, then redirect
back to the list of contacts with a success flash message.

No need for a template in this case, the contact is gone.

=== Contact.app... Implemented!

And, well... believe it or not, that's our entire contact application!

If you've struggled with parts of the code so far, don't worry: we don't expect you to be a Python or Flask expert (we aren't!). You just need a basic understanding of how they work to benefit from the remainder of the book.

This is a small and simple application, but it does demonstrate many of the aspects of
traditional, web 1.0 applications: CRUD, the Post/Redirect/Get pattern, working
with domain logic in a controller, organizing our URLs in a coherent, resource-oriented manner.

And, furthermore, this is a deeply _Hypermedia-Driven_ web application.  Without thinking about it very much, we have
been using REST, HATEOAS and all the other hypermedia concepts we discussed earlier.  We would bet that this simple
little contact app of ours is more RESTful than 99% of all JSON APIs ever built!

Just by virtue of using a _hypermedia_, HTML, we naturally fall into the RESTful network
architecture.

So that's great.  But what's the matter with this little web app?  Why not end here and go off to develop web 1.0 style
applications?

Well, at some level, nothing is wrong with it.  Particularly for an application as simple as this one, the older
way of building web apps might be a perfectly acceptable approach.

However, our application does suffer from that "`clunkiness`" that we mentioned earlier when discussing web 1.0 applications:
every request replaces the entire screen, introducing a noticeable flicker when navigating between pages.  You lose your
scroll state.  You have to click around a bit more than you might in a more sophisticated web application.

Contact.app, at this point, just doesn't feel like a "`modern`" web application.

Is it time to reach for a JavaScript framework and JSON APIs to make our contact application more interactive?

No.  No it isn't.

It turns out that we can improve the user experience of this application while retaining its fundamental hypermedia
architecture.

In the next few chapters we will look at https://htmx.org[htmx], a hypermedia-oriented library
that will let us improve our contact application while retaining the hypermedia-based approach we have used so far.

[.html-note]
== HTML Notes: Framework Soup

(((components)))
Components encapsulate a section of a page along with its dynamic behavior.
While encapsulating behavior is a good way to organize code,
it can also separate elements from their surrounding context,
which can lead to wrong or inadequate relationships between elements.
The result is what one might call [.dfn]_component soup_,
where information is hidden in component state,
rather than being present in the HTML, which is now incomprehensible due to missing context.

Before you reach for components for reuse, consider your options.
Lower-level mechanisms often (allow you to) produce better HTML.
In some cases, components can actually _improve_ the clarity of your HTML.

[quote, Manuel Matuzović, 'https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism[Why I\'m not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications]']
The fact that the HTML document is something that you barely touch, because everything you need in there will be injected via JavaScript, puts the document and the page structure out of focus.

In order to avoid `<div>` soup (or Markdown soup, or Component soup), you need to be aware of the markup you're producing and be able to change it.

Some SPA frameworks, and some web components, make this more difficult by putting layers of abstraction between the code the developer writes and the generated markup.

While these abstractions can allow developers to create richer UI or work faster,
their pervasiveness means that developers can lose sight of the actual HTML (and JavaScript) being sent to clients.
Without diligent testing, this leads to inaccessibility, poor SEO, and bloat.
