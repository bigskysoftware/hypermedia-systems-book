== Advanced Htmx

In this chapter we are going to look deeper into the htmx toolkit.  We've accomplished quite a bit with what we've
learned so far. Still, when you are developing Hypermedia-Driven Applications, there will be times when you need to
reach for additional options and techniques.

We will go over the more advanced attributes in htmx, as well as expand on the advanced details of attributes we have
already used.

Additionally, we will look at functionality that htmx offers beyond simple HTML attributes:  how htmx extends
standard HTTP request and responses, how htmx works with (and produces) events, and how to approach situations where
there isn't a simple, single target on the page to be updated.

Finally, we will take a look at practical considerations when doing htmx development: how to debug htmx-based applications
effectively, security considerations you will need to take into account when working with htmx, and how to configure
the behavior of htmx.

With the features and techniques in this chapter, you will be able to pull off extremely
sophisticated user interfaces using only htmx and perhaps a small bit of hypermedia-friendly client-side scripting.

== Htmx Attributes

(((htmx, attributes)))
Thus far we have used about fifteen different attributes from htmx in our application.  The most important ones have been:

`hx-get`, `hx-post`, etc.::
To specify the AJAX request an element should make

`hx-trigger`::
To specify the event that triggers a request

`hx-swap`::
To specify how to swap the returned HTML content into the DOM

`hx-target`::
To specify where in the DOM to swap the returned HTML content

Two of these attributes, `hx-swap` and `hx-trigger`, support a number of useful options for creating more advanced
Hypermedia-Driven Applications.


=== hx-swap

(((hx-swap)))
We'll start with the `hx-swap` attribute. This is often not included on elements that issue htmx-driven requests because
its default behavior -- `innerHTML`, which swaps the inner HTML of the element -- tends to cover most use cases.

We earlier saw situations where we wanted to override the default behavior and use `outerHTML`, for example.  And, in
Chapter 2, we discussed some other swap options beyond these two, `beforebegin`, `afterend`, etc.

In Chapter 5, we also looked at the `swap` delay modifier for `hx-swap`, which allowed us to fade some content out
before it was removed from the DOM.

In addition to these, `hx-swap` offers further control with the following modifiers:

`settle`::
(((hx-swap, settle))) 
Like `swap`, this allows you to apply a specific delay between when the content has been swapped into the DOM and when
its attributes are "`settled`", that is, updated from their old values (if any) to their new values. This can give you
fine-grained control over CSS transitions.

`show`::
(((hx-swap, show))) 
Allows you to specify an element that should be shown -- that is, scrolled into the viewport of the browser if
necessary -- when a request is completed.

`scroll`::
(((hx-swap, scroll))) 
Allows you to specify a scrollable element (that is, an element with scrollbars), that should be scrolled to the top or
bottom when a request is completed.


`focus-scroll`::
(((hx-swap, focus-scroll))) 
Allows you to specify that htmx should scroll to the focused element when a request completes. The default for this
modifier is "`false.`"

So, for example, if we had a button that issued a `GET` request, and we wished to scroll to the top of the `body` element
when the request completed, we would write the following HTML:

.Scrolling to the top of the page
[source, html]
----
<button hx-get="/contacts" hx-target="#content-div"
        hx-swap="innerHTML show:body:top"> <1>
  Get Contacts
</button>
----
<1> This tells htmx to show the top of the body after the swap occurs.

More details and examples can be found online in the `hx-swap` https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/[documentation].


=== hx-trigger
(((hx-trigger, about)))
(((hx-trigger, element defaults)))
Like `hx-swap`, `hx-trigger` can often be omitted when you are using htmx, because the default behavior is typically
what you want.  Recall the default triggering events are determined by an element's type:

* Requests on `input`, `textarea` & `select` elements are triggered by the `change` event.
* Requests on `form` elements are triggered on the `submit` event.
* Requests on all other elements are triggered by the `click` event.

There are times, however, when you want a more elaborate trigger specification.  A classic example is the active search
example we implemented in Contact.app:

.The active search input
[source,html]
----
    <input id="search" type="search" name="q" value="{{ request.args.get('q') or '' }}"
           hx-get="/contacts"
           hx-trigger="search, keyup delay:200ms changed"/> <1>
----
<1> An elaborate trigger specification.

This example took advantage of two modifiers available for the `hx-trigger` attribute:

`delay`::
(((hx-trigger, delay)))
Allows you to specify a delay to wait before a request is issued.  If the event occurs again, the first event is discarded and the timer resets.  This allows you to "`debounce`" requests.

`changed`::
(((hx-trigger, changed)))
Allows you to specify that a request should only be issued when the `value` property of the given element has changed.

`hx-trigger` has several additional modifiers.  This makes sense, because events are fairly complex and we want to be
able to take advantage of all the power they offer.  We will discuss events in more detail below.

Here are the other modifiers available on `hx-trigger`:

`once`::
(((hx-trigger, once)))  
The given event will only trigger a request once.

`throttle`::
(((hx-trigger, throttle)))
Allows you to throttle events, only issuing them once every certain interval.  This is different than `delay` in that
the first event will trigger immediately, but any following events will not trigger until the throttle time period
has elapsed.

`from`::
(((hx-trigger, from)))
A CSS selector that allows you to pick another element to listen for events on.  We will see an example of this used later in the chapter.

`target`::
(((hx-trigger, target)))
  A CSS selector that allows you to filter events to only those that occur directly on a given element.  In the DOM,
  events "`bubble`" to their parent elements, so a `click` event on a button will also trigger a `click` event on a parent
  `div`, all the way up to the `body` element.  Sometimes you want to specify an event directly on a given element, and
  this attribute allows you to do that.

`consume`::
(((hx-trigger, consume)))
  If this option is set to `true`, the triggering event will be cancelled and not propagate to parent elements.

`queue`::
(((hx-trigger, queue)))
  This option allows you to specify how events are queued in htmx.  By default, when htmx receives a triggering event,
  it will issue a request and start an event queue.  If the request is still in flight when another event is received,
  it will queue the event and, when the request finishes, trigger a new request.  By default, it only keeps the last
  event it receives, but you can modify that behavior using this option: for example, you can set it to `none` and ignore
  all triggering events that occur during a request.

==== Trigger filters

(((hx-trigger, event filters)))
The `hx-trigger` attribute also allows you to specify a _filter_ for events by using square brackets enclosing a
JavaScript expression after the event name.

Let's say you have a complex situation where contacts should only be retrievable in certain situations. You have
a JavaScript function, `contactRetrievalEnabled()` that returns a boolean, `true` if contacts can be retrieved and
`false` otherwise.  How could you use this function to place a gate on a button that issues a request to `/contacts`?

To do this using an event filter in htmx, you would write the following HTML:

.The active search input
[source,html]
----
<script>
  function contactRetrievalEnabled() {
      // code to test if contact retrieval is enabled
      ...
  }
</script>
<button hx-get="/contacts" hx-trigger="click[contactRetrievalEnabled()]"> <1>
  Get Contacts
</button>
----
<1> A request is issued on click only when `contactRetrievalEnabled()` returns `true`.

The button will not issue a request if `contactRetrievalEnabled()` returns false, allowing you to dynamically control
when the request will be made.  There are common situations that call for an event trigger, when you only want to issue
a request under specific circumstances:

* if a certain element has focus
* if a given form is valid
* if a set of inputs have specific values

Using event filters, you can use whatever logic you'd like to filter requests by htmx.


==== Synthetic events

(((hx-trigger, "synthetic events")))
In addition to these modifiers, `hx-trigger` offers a few "`synthetic`" events, that is events that are not part of the
regular DOM API.  We have already seen `load` and `revealed` in our lazy loading and infinite scroll examples, but
htmx also gives you an `intersect` event that triggers when an element intersects its parent element.

(((hx-trigger, intersect)))
This synthetic event uses the modern Intersection Observer API, which you can read more about
at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API[MDN].

Intersection gives you fine-grained control over exactly when a request should be triggered.  For example, you can
set a threshold and specify that the request be issued only when an element is 50% visible.

The `hx-trigger` attribute certainly is the most complex in htmx. More details and examples can be found in its
https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/[documentation].

=== Other Attributes

Htmx offers many other less commonly used attributes for fine-tuning the behavior of your Hypermedia-Driven Application.

Here are some of the most useful ones:

hx-push-url::
(((hx-push-url)))
  "`Pushes`" the request URL (or some other value) into the navigation bar.

hx-preserve::
(((hx-preserve)))
  Preserves a bit of the DOM between requests; the original content will be kept, regardless of what is returned.

hx-sync::
(((hx-sync)))
  Synchronized requests between two or more elements.

hx-disable::
(((hx-disable)))
  Disables htmx behavior on this element and any children.  We will come back to this when we discuss the topic of security.

Let's take a look at `hx-sync`, which allows us to synchronize AJAX requests between two or more elements.  Consider
a simple case where we have two buttons that both target the same element on the screen:

.Two competing buttons
[source, html]
----
<button hx-get="/contacts" hx-target="body"> <1>
  Get Contacts
</button>
<button hx-get="/settings" hx-target="body"> <1>
  Get Settings
</button>
----

This is fine and will work, but what if a user clicks the "`Get Contacts`" button and then the request takes a while to
respond?  And, in the meantime the user clicks the "`Get Settings`" button?  In this case we would have two requests in
flight at the same time.

If the `/settings` request finished first and displayed the user's setting information, they might be very surprised
if they began making changes and then, suddenly, the `/contacts` request finished and replaced the entire body with
the contacts instead!

To deal with this situation, we might consider using an `hx-indicator` to alert the user that something is going on, making
it less likely that they click the second button.  But if we really want to guarantee that there is only one request
at a time issued between these two buttons, the right thing to do is to use the `hx-sync` attribute.  Let's enclose
both buttons in a `div` and eliminate the redundant `hx-target` specification by hoisting the attribute up to that
`div`.  We can then use `hx-sync` on that div to coordinate requests between the two buttons.

Here is our updated code:

(((hx-sync, example)))

.Syncing two buttons
[source, html]
----
<div hx-target="body"  <1>
     hx-sync="this">  <2>
    <button hx-get="/contacts"> <1>
      Get Contacts
    </button>
    <button hx-get="/settings"> <1>
      Get Settings
    </button>
</div>
----
<1> Hoist the duplicate `hx-target` attributes to the parent `div`.
<2> Synchronize on the parent `div`.

By placing the `hx-sync` attribute on the `div` with the value `this`, we are saying "`Synchronize all htmx requests that
occur within this `div` element with one another.`"  This means that if one button already has a request in flight, other
buttons within the `div` will not issue requests until that has finished.

The `hx-sync` attribute supports a few different strategies that allow you to, for example, replace an existing request
in flight, or queue requests with a particular queuing strategy.  You can find complete documentation, as well as
examples, at the htmx.org page for https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sync/[`hx-sync`].

As you can see, htmx offers a lot of attribute-driven functionality for more advanced Hypermedia-Driven Applications.
A complete reference for all htmx attributes can be found https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes[on the htmx website].


== Events

(((events)))
Thus far we have worked with JavaScript events in htmx primarily via the `hx-trigger` attribute.  This attribute has
proven to be a powerful mechanism for driving our application using a declarative, HTML-friendly syntax.

However, there is much more we can do with events. Events play a crucial role both in the extension of HTML as a
hypermedia, and, as we'll see, in hypermedia-friendly scripting. Events are the "`glue`" that brings the DOM, HTML,
htmx and scripting together. You might think of the DOM as a sophisticated "event bus" for applications.

We can't emphasize enough: to build advanced Hypermedia-Driven Applications, it is worth the effort to learn about events
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events[in depth].

=== Htmx-Generated Events

((("htmx events")))
In addition to making it easy to _respond_ to events, htmx also _emits_ many useful events.  You can use these events to
add more functionality to your application, either via htmx itself, or by way of scripting.

Here are some of the most commonly used events triggered by htmx:

`htmx:load`::
((("htmx events", "htmx:load")))
  Triggered when new content is loaded into the DOM by htmx.

`htmx:configRequest`::
((("htmx events", "htmx:configRequest")))
  Triggered before a request is issued, allowing you to programmatically configure the request or cancel it entirely.

`htmx:afterRequest`::
((("htmx events", "htmx:afterRequest")))
  Triggered after a request has responded.

`htmx:abort`::
((("htmx events", "htmx:abort")))
  A custom event that can be sent to an htmx-powered element to abort an open request.

=== Using the htmx:configRequest Event

Let's look at an example of how to work with htmx-emitted events. We'll use the `htmx:configRequest` event to configure
an HTTP request.

(((localStorage)))
Consider the following scenario: your server-side team has decided that they want you to include a server-generated
token for extra security on every request. The token is going to be stored in `localStorage` in the browser, in the slot
`special-token`.

The token is being set via some JavaScript (don't worry about the details yet) when the user first logs in:

.Getting The Token in JavaScript
[source,js]
----
    let response = await fetch("/token"); <1>
    localStorage['special-token'] = await response.text();
----
<1> Get the value of the token then set it into localStorage

The server-side team wants you to include this special token on every request made by htmx, as the `X-SPECIAL-TOKEN` header.
How could you achieve this?  One way would be to catch the `htmx:configRequest` event and update the `detail.headers`
object with this token from `localStorage`.

In VanillaJS, it would look something like this, placed in a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of our HTML document:

.Adding the `X-SPECIAL-TOKEN` header
[source,js]
----
document.body.addEventListener("htmx:configRequest", function(configEvent){
    configEvent.detail.headers['X-SPECIAL-TOKEN'] = localStorage['special-token']; <1>
})
----
<1> Retrieve the value from local storage and set it into a header.

As you can see, we add a new value to the `headers` property of the event's detail property.  After the event handler
executes, this `headers` property is read by htmx and used to construct the request headers for the AJAX request it makes.

The `detail` property of the `htmx:configRequest` event contains a slew of useful properties that you can update to change the
"shape" of the request, including:

`detail.parameters`::
((("htmx:configRequest", "detail.parameters")))
Allows you to add or remove request parameters

`detail.target`::
((("htmx:configRequest", "detail.target")))
Allows you to update the target of the request

`detail.verb`::
((("htmx:configRequest", "detail.verb")))
Allows you to update HTTP "verb" of the request (e.g. `GET`)

So, for example, if the server-side team decided they wanted the token included as a parameter, rather than as a
request header, you could update your code to look like this:

.Adding the `token` parameter
[source,js]
----
document.body.addEventListener("htmx:configRequest", function(configEvent){
    configEvent.detail.parameters['token'] = localStorage['special-token']; <1>
})
----
<1> Retrieve the value from local storage and set it into a parameter.

As you can see, this gives you a lot of flexibility in updating the AJAX request that htmx makes.

The full documentation for the `htmx:configRequest` event (and other events you might be interested in) can be found
https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:configRequest[on the htmx website].


=== Canceling a Request Using htmx:abort

((("htmx:abort")))
((("canceling a request")))
We can listen for any of the many useful events from htmx, and we can respond to those events using `hx-trigger`.  What
else can we do with events?

It turns out that htmx itself listens for one special event, `htmx:abort`.  When htmx receives this
event on an element that has a request in flight, it will abort the request.

Consider a situation where we have a potentially long-running request to `/contacts`, and we want to offer a way for
the users to cancel the request.  What we want is a button that issues the request, driven by htmx, of course, and then
another button that will send an `htmx:abort` event to the first one.

Here is what the code might look like:

.A button with an abort
[source, html]
----
<button id="contacts-btn" hx-get="/contacts" hx-target="body"> <1>
  Get Contacts
</button>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('contacts-btn').dispatchEvent(new Event('htmx:abort'))"> <2>
  Cancel
</button>
----
<1> A normal htmx-driven `GET` request to `/contacts`
<2> JavaScript to look up the button and send it an `htmx:abort` event

So now, if a user clicks on the "`Get Contacts`" button and the request takes a while, they can click on the "`Cancel`"
button and end the request.  Of course, in a more sophisticated user interface, you may want to disable the "`Cancel`"
button unless an HTTP request is in flight, but that would be a pain to implement in pure JavaScript.

Thankfully this isn't too bad to implement in hyperscript, so let's take a look at what that would look like:

.A hyperscript-Powered Button With An Abort
[source, html]
----
<button id="contacts-btn" hx-get="/contacts" hx-target="body">
  Get Contacts
</button>
<button _="on click send htmx:abort to #contacts-btn
           on htmx:beforeRequest from #contacts-btn remove @disabled from me
           on htmx:afterRequest from #contacts-btn add @disabled to me">
  Cancel
</button>
----

Now we have a "`Cancel`" button that is enabled only when a request from the `contacts-btn` button is in flight.  And
we are taking advantage of htmx-generated and handled events, as well as the event-friendly syntax of hyperscript, to
make it happen.  Slick!

=== Server Generated Events

We are going to talk more about the various ways that htmx enhances regular HTTP requests and responses in the next section,
but, since it involves events, we are going to discuss one HTTP Response header that htmx supports: `HX-Trigger`.  We
have discussed before how HTTP requests and responses support _headers_, name-value pairs that contain metadata about
a given request or response.  We took advantage of the `HX-Trigger` request header, which includes the id of the element
that triggered a given request.

((("response header", "HX-Trigger")))
In addition to this _request header_, htmx also supports a _response header_ also named `HX-Trigger`.  This response header
allows you to _trigger an event_ on the element that submitted an AJAX request.  This turns out to be a powerful way
to coordinate elements in the DOM in a decoupled manner.

To see how this might work, let's consider the following situation: we have a button that grabs new contacts from some
remote system on the server.  We will ignore the details of the server-side implementation, but we know that if we issue
a `POST` to the `/sync` path, it will trigger a synchronization with the system.

Now, this synchronization may or may not result in new contacts being created.  In the case where new contacts _are_
created, we want to refresh our contacts table.  In the case where no contacts are created, we don't want to refresh
the table.

To implement this we could conditionally add an `HX-Trigger` response header with the value `contacts-updated`:

.Conditionally Triggering a `contacts-updated` event
[source,py]
----
@app.route('/sync', methods=["POST"])
def sync_with_server():
    contacts_updated = RemoteServer.sync() <1>
    resp = make_response(render_template('sync.html'))
    if contacts_updated <2>
      resp.headers['HX-Trigger'] = 'contacts-updated'
    return resp
----
<1> A call to the remote system that synchronized our contact database with it
<2> If any contacts were updated we conditionally trigger the `contacts-updated` event on the client

This value would trigger the `contacts-updated` event on the button that
made the AJAX request to `/sync`.  We can then take advantage of the `from:` modifier of the `hx-trigger`
attribute to listen for that event. With this pattern we can effectively trigger htmx requests from the server side.

Here is what the client-side code might look like:

.The Contacts Table
[source, html]
----
   <button hx-post="/integrations/1"> <1>
     Pull Contacts From Integration
   </button>

      ...

    <table hx-get="/contacts/table" hx-trigger="contacts-updated from:body"> <2>
      ...
    </table>
----
<1> The response to this request may conditionally trigger the `contacts-updated` event
<2> This table listens for the event and refreshes when it occurs

The table listens for the `contacts-updated` event, and it does so on the `body` element.  It listens on the `body`
element since the event will bubble up from the button, and this allows us to not couple the button and table together:
we can move the button and table around as we like and, via events, the behavior we want will continue to work fine.
Additionally, we may want _other_ elements or requests to trigger the `contacts-updated` event, so this provides a
general mechanism for refreshing the contacts table in our application.

== HTTP Requests & Responses

We have just seen an advanced feature of HTTP responses supported by htmx, the `HX-Trigger` response header,
but htmx supports quite a few more headers for both requests and responses.  In Chapter 4 we discussed the
headers present in HTTP Requests.  Here are some of the more important headers you can use to change htmx behavior with
HTTP responses:

`HX-Location`::
 ((("response header", HX-Location)))
 Causes a client-side redirection to a new location

`HX-Push-Url`::
((("response header", HX-Push-Url)))
  Pushes a new URL into the location bar

`HX-Refresh`::
((("response header", HX-Refresh)))
  Refreshes the current page

`HX-Retarget`::
((("response header", HX-Retarget)))
  Allows you to specify a new target to swap the response content into on the client side

You can find a reference for all requests and response headers in the https://htmx.org/reference/#headers[htmx documentation].


=== HTTP Response Codes

((("HTTP response codes")))
Even more important than response headers, in terms of information conveyed to the client, is the _HTTP Response Code_.
We discussed HTTP Response Codes in Chapter 3.  By and large htmx handles various response codes in the manner that
you would expect: it swaps content for all 200-level response codes and does nothing for others.  There are, however,
two "`special`" 200-level response codes:

* `204 No Content` - When htmx receives this response code, it will _not_ swap any content into the DOM (even if the response
  has a body)
* `286` - When htmx receives this response code to a request that is polling, it will stop the polling

You can override the behavior of htmx with respect to response codes by, you guessed it, responding to an event!  The
`htmx:beforeSwap` event allows you to change the behavior of htmx with respect to various status codes.

Let's say that, rather than doing nothing when a `404` occurred, you wanted to alert the user that an error had occurred.
To do so, you want to invoke a JavaScript method, `showNotFoundError()`.  Let's add some code to use the `htmx:beforeSwap`
event to make this happen:

.Showing a 404 dialog
[source,js]
----
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:beforeSwap', function(evt) { <1>
    if(evt.detail.xhr.status === 404){ <2>
        showNotFoundError();
    }
});
----
<1> Hook into the `htmx:beforeSwap` event.
<2> If the response code is a `404`, show the user a dialog.

You can also use the `htmx:beforeSwap` event to configure if the response should be swapped into the DOM and what element
the response should target.  This gives you quite a bit of flexibility in choosing how you want to use HTTP Response
codes in your application.  Full documentation on the `htmx:beforeSwap` event can be found at https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:beforeSwap[htmx.org].

== Updating Other Content

Above we saw how to use a server-triggered event, via the `HX-Trigger` HTTP response header, to update a piece of the
DOM based on the response to another part of the DOM.  This technique addresses the general problem that comes up
in Hypermedia-Driven Applications: "`How do I update other content?`"  After all, in normal HTTP requests, there is only
one "`target`", the entire screen, and, similarly, in htmx-based requests, there is only one target: either the explicit
or implicit target of the element.

If you want to update other content in htmx, you have a few options:

=== Expanding Your Selection

The first option, and the simplest, is to "`expand the target.`" That is, rather than simply replacing a small part
of the screen, expand the target of your htmx-driven request until it is large enough to enclose all the elements that
need to be updated on a screen.  This has the tremendous advantage of being simple and reliable.  The downside is that
it may not provide the user experience that you want, and it may not play well with a particular server-side template
layout.  Regardless, we always recommend at least thinking about this approach first.


=== Out of Band Swaps

((("hx-swap-oob")))
(((htmx, "out of band swaps")))
A second option, a bit more complex, is to take advantage of "`Out Of Band`" content support in htmx.  When
htmx receives a response, it will inspect it for top-level content that includes the `hx-swap-oob` attribute.  That content will be removed from the response, so it will not be swapped into the DOM in the normal manner.  Instead,
it will be swapped in for the content that it matches by id.

Let's look at an example.  Consider the situation we had earlier, where a contacts table needs to be updated if an integration pulls down any new contacts.  Previously we solved this by using events and
a server-triggered event via the `HX-Trigger` response header.

This time, we'll use the `hx-swap-oob` attribute in the response to the
`POST` to `/integrations/1`. The new contacts table content will "`piggyback`" on the response.

.The updated contacts table
[source, html]
----
   <button hx-post="/integrations/1"> <1>
     Pull Contacts From Integration
   </button>

      ...

    <table id="contacts-table"> <2>
      ...
    </table>
----
<1> The button still issues a `POST` to `/integrations/1`.
<2> The table no longer listens for an event, but it now has an id.

Next, the response to the `POST` to `/integrations/1` will include the
content that needs to be swapped into the button, per the usual htmx mechanism.  But it will also include a new,
updated version of the contacts table, which will be marked as `hx-swap-oob="true"`.  This content will be removed from
the response so that it is not inserted into the button. Instead, it is swapped into the DOM in place of the existing
table since it has a matching id.

.A response with out-of-band content
[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
...

Pull Contacts From Integration <1>

<table id="contacts-table" hx-swap-oob="true"> <2>
  ...
</table>
----
<1> This content will be placed in the button.
<2> This content will be removed from the response and swapped by id.

Using this piggybacking technique, you can update content wherever needed on a page.
The `hx-swap-oob` attribute supports other additional features, all of which are https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/[documented].

Depending on how exactly your server-side templating technology works, and what level of interactivity your application
requires, out of band swapping can be a powerful mechanism for content updates.


=== Events

(((htmx patterns, server-triggered events)))
Finally, the most complex mechanism for updating content is the one we saw back in the events section: using server-triggered
events to update elements.  This approach can be very clean, but also requires a deeper conceptual knowledge of HTML
and events, and a commitment to the event-driven approach.  While we like this style of development, it isn't for everyone.
We typically recommend this pattern only if the htmx philosophy of event-driven hypermedia really speaks to you.

If it _does_ speak to you, however, we say: go for it.  We've created some very complex and flexible user interfaces using
this approach, and we are quite fond of it.

=== Being Pragmatic

(((hypermedia, limitations)))
All of these approaches to the "`Updating Other Content`" problem will work, and will often work well.  However, there may
come a point where it would just be simpler to use a different approach for your UI, like the reactive one.  As much as we like
the hypermedia approach, the reality is that there are some UX patterns that simply cannot be implemented
easily using it.  The canonical example of this sort of pattern, which we have mentioned before, is something like a live
online spreadsheet: it is simply too complex a user interface, with too many interdependencies, to be done well via
exchanges of hypermedia with a server.

In cases like this, and any time you feel like an htmx-based solution is proving to be more complex than another approach
might be, we recommend that you consider a different technology. Be pragmatic, and use the right tool for the job.  You can always
use htmx for the parts of your application that aren't as complex and don't need the full complexity of a reactive framework,
and save that complexity budget for the parts that do.

We encourage you to learn many different web technologies, with an eye to the strengths
and weaknesses of each one.  This will give you a deep tool chest to reach into when problems present themselves. Our
experience is that, with htmx, hypermedia is a tool you can reach for frequently.


== Debugging

(((events, debugging)))
(((htmx, debugging)))
We are not ashamed to admit: we are big fans of events.  They
are the underlying technology of almost any interesting user interface, and are particularly useful in the DOM once they
have been unlocked for general use in HTML.  They let you build nicely decoupled software while often preserving
the locality of behavior we like so much.

However, events are not perfect. One area where events can be particularly tricky to deal with is _debugging_: you
often want to know why an event _isn't_ happening.  But where can you set a break point for something that _isn't_ happening?
The answer, as of right now, is: you can't.

There are two techniques that can help in this regard, one provided by htmx, the other provided by Chrome, the browser
by Google.

=== Logging Htmx Events

The first technique, provided by htmx itself, is to call the `htmx.logAll()` method.  When you do this, htmx will log
all the internal events that occur as it goes about its business, loading up content, responding to events and so forth.

This can be overwhelming, but with judicious filtering can help you zero in on a problem.  Here are what (a bit of) the logs
look like when clicking on the "`docs`" link on https://htmx.org, with `logAll()` enabled:

.Htmx logs
[source, text]
----
htmx:configRequest
<a href="/docs/">
Object { parameters: {}, unfilteredParameters: {}, headers: {…}, target: body, verb: "get", errors: [], withCredentials: false, timeout: 0, path: "/docs/", triggeringEvent: a
, … }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:beforeRequest
<a href="/docs/">
Object { xhr: XMLHttpRequest, target: body, requestConfig: {…}, etc: {}, pathInfo: {…}, elt: a
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:beforeSend
<a class="htmx-request" href="/docs/">
Object { xhr: XMLHttpRequest, target: body, requestConfig: {…}, etc: {}, pathInfo: {…}, elt: a.htmx-request
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:xhr:loadstart
<a class="htmx-request" href="/docs/">
Object { lengthComputable: false, loaded: 0, total: 0, elt: a.htmx-request
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:xhr:progress
<a class="htmx-request" href="/docs/">
Object { lengthComputable: true, loaded: 4096, total: 19915, elt: a.htmx-request
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:xhr:progress
<a class="htmx-request" href="/docs/">
Object { lengthComputable: true, loaded: 19915, total: 19915, elt: a.htmx-request
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:beforeOnLoad
<a class="htmx-request" href="/docs/">
Object { xhr: XMLHttpRequest, target: body, requestConfig: {…}, etc: {}, pathInfo: {…}, elt: a.htmx-request
 }
htmx.js:439:29
htmx:beforeSwap
<body hx-ext="class-tools, preload">
----

Not exactly easy on the eyes, is it?

But, if you take a deep breath and squint, you can see that it isn't
_that_ bad: a series of htmx events, some of which we have seen before (there's `htmx:configRequest`!), get logged
to the console, along with the element they are triggered on.

After a bit of reading and filtering, you will be
able to make sense of the event stream, and it can help you debug htmx-related issues.

=== Monitoring Events in Chrome

The preceding technique is useful if the problem is occurring somewhere _within_ htmx, but what if htmx is never getting
triggered at all?  This comes up some times, like when, for example, you have accidentally typed an event name incorrectly
somewhere.

In cases like this you will need recourse to a tool available in the browser itself.  Fortunately, the Chrome browser
by Google provides a very useful function, `monitorEvents()`, that allows you to monitor _all_ events that are triggered
on an element.

This feature is available _only_ in the console, so you can't use it in code on your page.  But, if
you are working with htmx in Chrome, and are curious why an event isn't triggering on an element, you can open the
developers console and type the following:

.Htmx logs
[source, javascript]
----
monitorEvents(document.getElementById("some-element"));
----

This will then print _all_ the events that are triggered on the element with the id `some-element` to the console.  This
can be very useful for understanding exactly which events you want to respond to with htmx, or troubleshooting why an
expected event isn't occurring.

Using these two techniques will help you as you (infrequently, we hope) troubleshoot event-related issues when developing
with htmx.

== Security Considerations

(((htmx, security)))
(((security)))
In general, htmx and hypermedia tends to be more secure than JavaScript heavy approaches to building web applications. This
is because, by moving much of the processing to the back end, the hypermedia approach tends not to expose as much surface
area of your system to end users for manipulation and shenanigans.

However, even with hypermedia, there are still situations that require care when doing development.  Of particular
concern are situations where user-generated content is shown to other users: a clever user might try to insert
htmx code that tricks the other users into clicking on content that triggers actions they don't want to take.

In general, all user-generated content should be escaped on the server-side, and most server-side rendering frameworks
provide functionality for handling this situation.  But there is always a risk that something slips through the cracks.

(((hx-disable)))
In order to help you sleep better at night, htmx provides the `hx-disable` attribute.  When this attribute is placed
on an element, all htmx attributes within that element will be ignored.

=== Content Security Policies & Htmx

((("Content Security Policy (CSP)")))
A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser technology that allows you to detect and prevent certain types of
content injection-based attacks.  A full discussion of CSPs is beyond the scope of this book, but we refer you to
the  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[Mozilla Developer Network article] on the topic for more information.

A common feature to disable using a CSP is the `eval()` feature of JavaScript, which allows you to evaluate arbitrary
JavaScript code from a string.  This has proven to be a security issue and many teams have decided that it is not worth
the risk to keep it enabled in their web applications.

((("event filters", security)))
Htmx does not make heavy use of `eval()` and, thus, a CSP with this restriction in place will be fine.  The one
feature that does rely on `eval()` is event filters, discussed above.  If you decide to disable `eval()` for your
web application, you will not be able to use the event filtering syntax.

== Configuring

(((htmx, configuration)))
There are a large number of configuration options available for htmx.  Some examples of things you can configure are:

* The default swap style
* The default swap delay
* The default timeout of AJAX requests

A full list of configuration options can be found in the config section of the https://htmx.org/docs/#config[main htmx documentation].

Htmx is typically configured via a `meta` tag, found in the header of a page.  The name of the meta tag should be
`htmx-config`, and the content attribute should contain the configuration overrides, formatted as JSON.  Here is
an example:

.An htmx configuration via `meta` tag
[source, html]
----
<meta name="htmx-config" content='{"defaultSwapStyle":"outerHTML"}'>
----

In this case, we are overriding the default swap style from the usual `innerHTML` to `outerHTML`.  This might be useful
if you find yourself using `outerHTML` more frequently than `innerHTML` and want to avoid having to explicitly set that
swap value throughout your application.

== HTML Notes: Semantic HTML

Telling people to "use semantic HTML" instead of "read the spec" has led to a lot of people guessing at the meaning of tags -- "`looks pretty semantic to me!" -- instead of engaging with the spec.

[quote,https://t-ravis.com/post/doc/semantic_the_8_letter_s-word/]
I think being asked to write _meaningful_ HTML better lights the path to realizing that it isn't about what the text means to humans--it's about using tags for the purpose outlined in the specs to meet the needs of software like browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines.

We recommend talking about, and writing, _conformant_ HTML.
(We can always bikeshed further).
Use the elements to the full extent provided by the HTML specification,
and let the software take from it whatever meaning they can.
